Quickstart
----------

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::

    pip install -U cookiecutter

Generate a Python package project::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

Then:

* Create a repo and put it there.
* Add the repo to your Travis-CI_ account.
* Install the dev requirements into a virtualenv. (``pip install -r requirements_dev.txt``)
* Register_ your project with PyPI.
* Run the Travis CLI command ``travis encrypt --add deploy.password`` to encrypt your PyPI password in Travis config
  and activate automated deployment on PyPI when you push a new tag to master branch.
* Add the repo to your `Read the Docs`_ account + turn on the Read the Docs service hook.
* Release your package by pushing a new tag to master.
* Add a ``requirements.txt`` file that specifies the packages you will need for
  your project and their versions. For more info see the `pip docs for requirements files`_.
* Activate your project on `pyup.io`_.
